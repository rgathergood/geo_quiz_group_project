# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content

## How to run

To run our app you'll have to do the following:

- Clone this repo

In your terminal run:

- npm install
- npm run build
- npm run server:dev (separate tab)

- Install mongodb
- mongod (separate tab)

Go to: localhost:3000

Test your knowledge!
